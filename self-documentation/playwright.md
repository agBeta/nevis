## install
`npm init playwright@latest` --> said no `n` to browser and system deps.
You can can install them manually for only one browser (according to [docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers#install-system-dependencies)) using `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`. **BUT...***
But you can use current installed version of chrome, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/71187812.
