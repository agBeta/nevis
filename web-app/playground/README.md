In these files we play with third-party libraries or even some internals to figure out how they work. **Don't** delete these files and commit them to repo. Because for example if a test which exploits some third-party package fails, it takes time to figure out again how that package works. But if you have a related playground file for that package, you can quickly come the file and figure out how that package works. In addition, since the common setup is already established in the playground files, you can investigate the package or tool even further without wasting time for setup and learning basic.

Moreover, examples inside playground files are specific to the use cases of the project. This will reduce search fatigue, as the maintainer doesn't have to go through whole documentation of the tool to find about that specific use case or function.

It also helps production bugs to be found easier.

But the downside is that you won't be notified of newer APIs of the package you are using, as the maintainer isn't obliged to explore.
