*A Personal Mini Project*

Welcome.
   
Here are some of tools and patterns used in this project. For educational purposes, we decided to not use any Frameworks, build tools, transpilers, uglifiers, etc on the client side.  

- Type-checked Javascript (using js-doc)
- Client Side Routing (No frameworks)  
- Session Based Authentication (No frameworks)  
- API Pagination (according to [the article](https://mysql.rjweb.org/doc.php/pagination) by Mr Rich James)  
- Unit & Integration Testing (No frameworks, using Nodejs native test-runner), though huge parts of the codebase is still uncovered. Having 100% test coverage is out of scope of this mini project.  
- Basic Caching (Redis)  
- (Semi-?)Idempotent POST  
- E2E Testing (Playwright)
