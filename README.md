*A Personal Mini Project to Practice Some Tools and Techniques in JS land*

Welcome.

This project is **not** production-quality at all. Anyway, here are some of tools and patterns used in this project:
  
- Client Side Routing (No frameworks)  
- Session Based Authentication (No frameworks)  
- API Pagination (according to [this article](https://mysql.rjweb.org/doc.php/pagination) by Mr Rich James)  
- Unit & Integration Testing (No frameworks, using Nodejs native test-runner), though huge parts of the codebase is still uncovered. Having 100% test coverage is out of scope of this mini project.  
- Basic Caching (Redis)
- E2E Testing (Playwright)
